# PozeGen-CodeRed-24
## PozeGen - Personalized Pose Reccomendation and Generation Tool
An AI-powered system recommends and generates poses based on user and environmental constraints.
The system categorizes suitable environments and outfits by analyzing image backgrounds or user-provided prompts.
The system detects key points on the human body (joints, limbs, head, etc.), ensuring accurate understanding of the user's body positioning.
AI models generate recommended poses, facilitating better user understanding.
Advanced Generative AI Models (e.g., Stable Diffusion Models) transform user-input images and prompts into recommended poses.
The system provides personalized pose suggestions tailored to user profile details such as preferences, characteristics, and goals (yoga, aesthetics, fitness, etc.).
